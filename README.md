We propose a robust and efficient flow estimator tailored for real-time HDR video reconstruction, named HDRFlow. HDRFlow predicts HDR-oriented optical flow and exhibits robustness to large motions. We compare our HDR-oriented flow with RAFT's flow. RAFT's flow is sub-optimal for HDR fusion, and alignment may fail in occluded regions, leading to significant ghosting artifacts in the HDR output.<br>
Compared to previous SOTA methods, our HDRFlow enables real-time reconstruction of HDR video from video sequences captured with alternating exposures.
